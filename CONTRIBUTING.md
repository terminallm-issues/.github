## Bug Reports

Good bug reports help us fix issues faster. Please include:

- **Steps to reproduce** — the exact sequence that triggers the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior** — what you thought would happen vs what did
- **Screenshots** — especially for UI issues
- **Server info** — OS, shell, and whether dtach is installed (if the issue involves sessions)

Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/terminallm-issues/.github/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) template.
